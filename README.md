# IRIS Classification

This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species based on various features.

## Project Structure

- `IRIS CLASSIFICATION.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/krithikajagannathan/house-price-prediction.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "IRIS CLASSIFICATION.ipynb"
    ```

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is loaded directly within the notebook using the `sklearn.datasets` module.

## Model

- **Algorithms Used**: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

## Results
